<font color='black'><b>2.Two TEDsters nominated for Oscars and more TED community news</b></font>
<p>Posted by: Yasmin Belkhyr	February 22, 2019	at 4:21 pm EDT As usual, the TED community is making headlines. Below, some highlights. A close look at the beauty and pain of hospice care. End Game, a short documentary that follows the last few days of terminally ill patients, is up for an Oscar this weekend. The heart-rending film highlights the work of doctors and caregivers â€” including BJ Miller â€” reimagining what palliative care and hospice work can be. In a column for Hollywood Reporter, Motion Picture and Television Fund head Bob Beitcher says, â€œEnd Gameâ€™s Dr. BJ Miller embodies the commitment and compassion that is crucial to cutting-edge palliative care, helping families and patients travel the difficult journey together.â€ The film is streaming on Netflix. (Watch Millerâ€™s TED Talk.) Also up for an Oscar? Period. End of Sentence. Entrepreneur Arunachalam Muruganantham kickstarted a cultural revolution in India with his sanitary pad machine, and now the tale is a compelling Netflix documentary. The Oscar-nominated short doc explains how Murugananthamâ€™s invention empowers rural women, providing them with both clean sanitary napkins and reliable employment, while reducing stigma. â€œThe strongest creature created by God in the world is not the lion, not the elephant, not the tiger â€¦ the girl,â€ says Muruganantham in the film. (Watch Murugananthamâ€™s TED Talk.) Nita Farahany co-leads AI seminars for congressional staff. Alongside Vincent Conitzer and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, ethicist Nita Farahany kicked off the three-part Duke in DC seminar series on artificial intelligence for a congressional audience. Farahany, a professor of law and philosophy at Duke University, spoke on the potential impact of AI and human collaboration on policy. Questions ranged from predictive policing methodologies to the role of government in AI development. As quoted on Dukeâ€™s website, Farahany said, â€œBecause AI is still in such a nascent phase of its development, and because we as a society are going to increasingly face ethical and legal dilemmas from its use and development, there is an important role for government in the field.â€
