<font color='black'><b>1.How to go incognito in Google Chrome</b></font>
<p>Although incognito has become a label for any browser's private mode, that's what Google named the feature when it debuted in late 2008, just months after the search giant launched its browser.

The easiest way to open an Incognito window is with the keyboard shortcut combination Ctrl-Shift-N (Windows) or Command-Shift-N (macOS).

Another way is to click on the menu on the upper right â€” it's three vertical dots â€” and select New Incognito Window from the list.</p>
<font color='black'><b>2.Blockchain vs. a database: What's the difference?</b></font>
<p>Blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been touted as the answer for just about every transactional issue facing the world today â€“ from payment processing and supply chain tracking to digital identities and copyright protection.

Databases, however, have been serving those same use cases for decades. They record how much money is in a bank account, when cargo reaches a destination and they store the identities of business users â€“ enabling access to business applications and sensitive data.

Because of those similarities, there are cynics (some may even call them pragmatists) who believe once you strip away the hype associated with blockchain and its cryptocurrency origins, what you have left is nothing more than a fancy, but slow and expensive, database.

<font color='black'><b>3.Mobile world Congress 2019: Where smartphone battles unfolded</b></font>
<p>           
One of the biggest headline grabbers was foldable smartphones. While Samsung went 
first and slightly before MWC with its Galaxy Fold, Huawei made a major splash with its Mate X at MWC. And even some non-household names had foldables (e.g., Royole).
 Is there really a future for a phone that cost $2,000 or more? The current models were specifically designed to
  be â€œhaloâ€ devices that appeal only to the elite buyer. And, yes, there are plenty of buyers who are willing to spend $2K 
  or more on a premiere device that buys them a unique status position and bragging rights. But the better way to evaluate 
  these devices is to look at what it means for the long term evolution of smartphones.</p>
