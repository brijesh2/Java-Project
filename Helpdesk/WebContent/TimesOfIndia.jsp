<font color='black'><b>1.Social Media Can Do With a Detergent</b></font>
<p>March 11, 2019, 11:04 PM IST ET Edit in ET Editorials | Edit Page, India | ET A wise man points at the moon and the idiot looks at the finger. There is no other way to describe the vitriolic reactions on social media to a Surf Excel advertisement whose basic intent is, let us not forget, to drive home the cleaning prowess of a detergent brand. Hindustan Unileverâ€™s charming TV ad showing a girl braving the fun fusillade of Holi colours has got the bakra of many self-styled hyper-sensitive upholders of â€˜Hindu cultureâ€™. It culminates in her giving a lift on her cycle to a boy and â€˜savingâ€™ his snow-white kurta-pajama-skullcap from getting doused in Holi colours. Yes, the boyâ€™s Muslim.

<font color='black'><b>2.Politicise Surgical Strikes: BJP is undermining Indiaâ€™s strategic options by making them a poll issue</b></font>
<p>March 11, 2019, 11:14 AM IST Rudroneel Ghosh in Talking Turkey | India | TOI It is now clear that the post-Pulwama surgical strike is going to be a poll issue for BJP. In fact, at a recent event in Greater Noida, UP, PM Narendra Modi spoke of how his government had outwitted Pakistan. He said that Islamabad was bracing for a land retaliation but was struck from the air. His exact words were, â€œThey were thinking that Modi carried out surgical strikes last time and the same would happen the second time.â€ Clear from this statement is the fact that Modi is taking full credit for the military operation, even though he says he isnâ€™t. Meanwhile, we also had Union home minister Rajnath Singh asserting in Mangaluru that three, not two, surgical strikes were carried out by India in the last five years. But there is a good reason why military operations should not be politicised. First, if the party in power is going to play this game then the opposition too wonâ€™t sit quietly. We have already seen some leaders ask for details about the Balakot surgical strike. This is a slippery slope because it may not be prudent to provide full operational details. But if the government isnâ€™t forthcoming then it will create more doubts. Therefore, the party in power should refrain from touting such operations for political gains.
