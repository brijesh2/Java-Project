<font color='black'><b>1.Use This Simple Strategy to Manage Your Emotions More Effectively Be in touch with as much of your moment-to-moment experience as possible. By Quora</b></font>
<p>What are some strategies adults can use to more effectively manage their feelings? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world. Answer by Joan Rosenberg, Psychologist, TEDx Speaker and Professor, on Quora: I wrestled with understanding why it was/is so hard for people to experience unpleasant feelings, and the "simplest" strategy I've come up with you can read in my book "90 Seconds to a Life You Love" or watch in my TEDxSantaBarbara talk. I describe it as a formula: 1 choice / 8 feelings / 90 Seconds The 1 choice is to be as aware of and in touch with as much of your moment-to-moment experience as possible. The choice, then, is awareness, not avoidance. The second part of the formula is to be able to acknowledge, accept, experience and move through 8 unpleasant feelings (sadness, shame, helplessness, anger, vulnerability, embarrassment, disappointment and frustration). The third is to be able to ride 1 or more 90 second waves of bodily sensations. Here's how to understand the last part. The resource here is from Dr. Jill Bolte-Taylor... When a feeling fires off in the brain, there is a rush of biochemicals into the bloodstream - and that rush of biochemicals activate bodily sensations (think the heat or warmth in your chest or face associated with embarrassment or heaviness in the chest at the heart assoc with sadness, or the warmth of connecting with a close friend or love being experienced throughout your whole body); once we have conscious awareness of the bodily sensation, we often describe emotional/feeling words to describe the sensation. From Dr. Taylor's observations, these same biochemicals then flush out of the bloodstream in roughly 90 seconds.

<p>What are the best lessons you've learned as a serial entrepreneur? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world. Answer by Joshua Motta, CEO + Co-founder of Coalition, Inc., on Quora: As we age we are constantly developing mental models of how things work. These models are the culmination of our experiences, education, nature, and nurture. The best lesson I've learned as an entrepreneur is one that has fundamentally shaped this mental model and that has allowed me to take my unique points of view and unleash them into something productive. To see what others do not, and to take a novel approach to a problem (even problems believed to have been solved). This lesson is the importance of training yourself to reason using first principles. In other words, taking the time to really figure things out for yourself, and to consider a problem all the way down to its fundamental truths. This is as opposed to the normal way humans reason, which is often by analogy. When reasoning by analogy, you are reasoning based upon what has already been done, or what other people are doing -- which isn't terribly conducive to finding novel solutions to problems, which is at the very essence of being an entrepreneur.
